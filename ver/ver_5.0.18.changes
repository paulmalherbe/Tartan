Hi

There is a problem with Tartan 5.0.16 and 5.0.17 versions relating to the
letterhead on Invoices and Statements. Anyone who has downloaded and installed
these versions must please download 5.0.18 which corrects this problem. This
does not apply to users who make use of the logo field in the company record.

I apologise for any inconvenience.

Regards
