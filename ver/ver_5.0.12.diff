+
+Installation Procedure
+----------------------
+Browse to the Bwlclb_5.0.x file and double click on it. Accept all defaults and agree to creating an icon on your desktop.
+
+Tartan should now be installed on your computer and you can continue with the `Startup Procedure`_.
+
+Startup Procedure
+-----------------
+Start Tartan by clicking on the shortcut icon on the desktop or by navigating to the `C:\\Tartan\\prg` directory and double clicking on the `ms0000[.exe]` file.
+
+The first time you run Tartan you will automatically be taken to `Preferences`_ where you will have to enter various parameters relating to your installation. After saving the preferences and restarting Tartan you will be prompted to create the database. Once the database has been created you will have to create the System record as per `System Record`_ as well as a Club record as per `Club Master Record`_.
+
+Status Line
+-----------
+Please note that when using Tartan your available options will be highlighted on the status line at the bottom left hand side of the screen. Please always read this carefully before asking for assistance.
+
+Common Keyboard Functions
+-------------------------
+Throughout the various modules comprising **Tartan Systems** the following keys are used to perform certain functions. These options will always be highlighted in the `Status Line`_ at the bottom of the screen. The most common ones are:
+
++ **Enter**  - Accept keyboard input.
++ **Esc**    - Exit a module or go to a previous entry field.
++ **F1**     - Record Selection used with all data input routines.
++ **F5**     - Record Deletion used with record maintenance routines.
+
+In addition to the above keys, all underlined characters on notebook tags and buttons, can be used in conjunction with the <Alt> key as shortcuts e.g <Alt-s> to open the System menu.
+
+Common Routines
+---------------
+Printer Selection
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Whenever a report is being produced you will have the opportunity of deciding on the output method i.e. viewing, printing, exporting and, in some cases, whether or not to email it.  Please note that the option to email the report will only be available if there is a valid `SMTP Server` in the `System Record`_ record.
+
+* **Output** - Select the required output option.
+* **Printer Name** - If you selected `Print`, enter the printer name.
+* **E-Mail Report** - If available, select whether or not to email the report.
+* **E-Mail Address** - If available, enter the email address, if more than one, comma separate them.
+
+Error Messages
+--------------
+Should an error message occur and there is a file named *errors.txt* in the `Work Path` as created in `Preferences`_. Please email it to errors@tartan.co.za after which you may delete it.
+
+Menus and Sub Menus
+-------------------
+System
+~~~~~~
+Update File Formats
+...................
+Everytime you perfor an upgrade of Tartan you will have to run this routine as well. This routine will automatically update all table formats in the database.
+
+Backup Database
+...............
+Select this routine to create a backup of the current database. These backups will reside in the *Backup Path* directory as created using the `Preferences`_ routine. Each backup will further reside in a sub directory named after the name of the database and a further sub directory named `arch`.
+
+Restore Database
+................
+Select this routine to restore a previous backup.
+
++ **Type** - Select a Full or Partial restore.
++ **Archive** - Select the relevant archive to restore from.
++ **All Companies** - `Yes` or `Include/Exclude` some companies.
++ **Companies** - Comma separated list of companies to include or exclude.
++ **All Systems** - `Yes` or `Include/Exclude` some systems.
++ **Systems** - Comma separated list of systems to include or exclude.
+
+Please note that unless you really know what you are doing it is very dangerous to restore individual systems as your data could become unbalanced because of integration and table relationships.
+
+If you are doing a full restore and the database already exists you will be asked whether to drop it first. Unless you are sure of what you are doing select No.
+
+Preferences
+...........
+Use this routine to configure Tartan, however, depending on your security level, some of the options might not be available to you.
+
++ **Configuration File** - This is the full path of your configuration file. Every user can have his or her own file. This file, by default, is placed in the user's home directory or, in Windows, the root directory of the Tartan installation e.g. `C:\\Tartan`. If you want to change this default, you must set an environment variable as **TARTANRC=path-to-rcfile** or use the command line option **-r path-to-rcfile**.
+
++ **Database**
+
+    + **Database Engine** - This is the database being used and must be one of PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL or Firebird. The recommended one for single user installations is SQLite and PostgreSQL for multi-user installations.
+    + **Database Name** - This can be any single word name defaulting to **tartan**.
+    + **Host Name** - This is the host name of the Server. This is not used with SQLite.
+    + **Files Directory** - This is only used for SQLite and Firebird database engines and is the directory where the database will be created.
+    + **Port Number** - This is the port number the database uses. At this stage it is not in use.
+    + **Administrator** - This is the name used to connect to the database. This is not used with SQLite.
+    + **Password** - This is the password of the user. This is not necessary with SQLite.
+
++ **General**
+
+    + **Program Path** - This is the path where the programs reside.
+    + **Archive Path** - This is the path where archived reports will be stored.
+    + **Backup Path** - This is the path where backups of the database will be stored.
+    + **Work Path** - This is the path of the work directory. All temporary files will be created in this directory.
+    + **Upgrade Path** - This is the path where any upgrades will be stored.
+    + **PDF Viewer** - This is the full path of the program used to display pdf files.  The default for LINUX is **xpdf** and Windows is **SumatraPDF**. Other recommended programs for windows are **Foxit Reader** and **AcroRd32** version 4.05.
+    + **Print Command** - This is the full path of the print program used to print postscript files. The LINUX default is **lpr** and Windows is **SumatraPDF**. Other recommended programs for windows are **Foxit Reader** and **AcroRd32** version 4.05.
+    + **PS Converter** - This is the full path of the program needed to convert pdf files to postscript. The LINUX default is **pdftops** and the Windows one is **blank**.  If this field is left blank, no conversion will take place and the print routine will have to be able to print pdf files directly e.g. where one of `SumatraPDF`, `Foxit Reader` or `Acrobat Reader` has been selected as the printer.
+    + **CSV Reader** - This is the full path of the program used to display csv and xls file formats.
+    + **Screen Geometry** - This defaults to the suggested geometry for your screen.
+    + **Enforce Confirm** - Whether confirmation is required on the completion of data entry.
+    + **Auto-completion** - Whether auto-completion will be available. This means that as you enter data, and if there are available options, these will appear in a box below the entry field for selection.
+    + **Tool-tips** - Whether tool-tips will display as you hover your cursor over certain entry fields.
+    + **Text Viewer** - Whether to, when entering text in a field which is smaller than the allowed entry size, display the whole entry in a box below the entry field or not.
+    + **Entry Frame** - Whether or not to frame all entry fields.
+    + **Error Alarm** - Whether or not to sound an audible alarm with errors. This can be No, Yes or Multimedia. Use Multimedia if you do not have an internal speaker.
+
++ **Dialog**
+
+    + **Menu Font**
+
+        + **Name** - This is the font to be used for all menu items.
+        + **Size** - This is font size to be used for all menu items.
+
+    + **Default Font**
+
+        + **Name** - This is the font to be used in all other cases.
+        + **Size** - This is font size to be used in all other cases.
+
+    + **Theme** - The theme to be used. The default theme is `Default`.
+
+|

-About
------
-Tartan Systems started out in 1981 as a suite of programs I wrote in COBOL and until 1994 ran on various platforms including CPM, RSX11M, MSDOS, AT&T UNIX and SCO.
-
-In 1994 I discovered LINUX and when iBCS2 became available I modified the systems to run under LINUX and continue doing so until today.
-
-In 2003 I started looking around for another programming language in which I could rewrite the systems to   run under LINUX as well as Windows without having to recompile etc. Also I was getting irritated with having to compile using SCO.
-
-Eventually I decided on the following:
-
-+ Python_ as the programming language
-+ Tkinter_ for the graphical user interface
-+ Reportlab_ to generate reports
-+ Pychart_ to generate charts and graphs
-+ PostgreSQL_, MySQL_, Firebird_ and Pysqlite_ as supported relational databases
-
-In 2005, version 3, I changed the graphical user interface to PyGtk, a python wrapper for the Gtk library.
-
-In 2011, version 4, I dropped support for windows 9x and also replaced reportlab with pyfpdf.
-
-In 2015, version 5, I replaced PyGtk with Tkinter and ttk.

After saving the preferences and restarting Tartan you will be prompted to create the database. Once the database has been created you will have to create the System record as per `System Record Maintenance`_ as well as a Company record as per `Company Records Maintenance`_.
-
-Status Line
------------
-Please note that when using Tartan your available options will be highlighted on the status line at the bottom left hand side of the screen. Please read this carefully before asking for assistance.
-
-Common Keyboard Functions
--------------------------
-Throughout the various modules comprising **Tartan Systems** the following keys are used to perform certain functions. These options will always be highlighted in the `Status Line`_ at the bottom of the screen. The most common ones are:
-
-+ **Enter**  - Accept keyboard input.
-+ **Esc**    - Exit a module or go to a previous entry field.
-+ **F1**     - Record Selection used with most data input routines.
-+ **F5**     - Record Deletion used with record maintenance routines.
-+ **F9**     - Input Termination used with multi-line text input.
-
-In addition to the above keys all underlined characters on notebook tags and buttons can be used, in conjunction with the <Alt> key, as shortcuts e.g <Alt-s> to open the System menu.
-
-Common Routines
----------------
-There are various common routines. Rather than continually describing them they will be described once here only.
-
-User Validation
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-If no users have been created using the `User's Maintenance`_ routine on the `System`_ menu and no password has been allocated to the **admin** user, the system will automatically log in using **admin** as the user name. In all other cases a user must log in by entering a valid name and password. If no password exists for the **admin** user a password should be created as soon as possible using the `Change Password`_ routine on the System_ menu.
-
-Company Selection
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-For every routine which is company specific and where you have more than 1 company, you will be required to select the relevant company. In some cases you will also have to enter a financial period. Please note that you will not always be prompted for the financial period as this only applies to routines which require it. Also note that for both selections there is a `F1 Record Selection` option as per `Common Keyboard Functions`_.
-
-Batch Details
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Most data capture routines require you to enter batch details. The reason for a batch is ease of balancing and the resolution of errors made during data capture. After you exit a data capture routine a totals summary will be displayed. If there is a discrepancy between the expected and entered values all the various systems have a routine to print the batch details thus enabling you to determine where the error is and therefore to correct it.
-
-+ **Batch Number** - Any 7 character unique alphanumeric code.
-+ **Capture Date (CCYYMMDD)** - The date that this batch was first created.
-+ **Current Period (CCYYMM)** - The financial period of this batch.
-+ **Number of Entries** - The total number of entries comprising this batch, if known, else 0.
-+ **Value of Entries** - The total value of entries comprising this batch, if known, else 0.
-+ **Batched By** - The initials of the person who pre-listed the batch.
-+ **Captured By** - The initials of the person who created the batch.
-+ **Multiple Date Allocations** - Whether or not the postings are to be allocated according to the transaction date and not the current period.
-+ **Bank Control** - For all batches in general ledger and other systems integrated with the general ledger, that affect the bank accounts, enter the bank control code.
-
-Ageing Transactions
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-While capturing transactions for various systems you will be required to allocate the amount to existing outstanding transactions for ageing purposes.
-
-There are four different methods of ageing a transaction:
-
-+ **Normal** - This will display a list of all outstanding transactions on the account and you will be able to allocate at random until the full amount has been allocated.
-
-    + Select a transaction to allocate against by either clicking on the required line or moving the cursor to the required line and hitting the `Enter` key.
-    + Enter the allocation amount.
-    + Accept the allocation amount by either clicking on the `Apply` button or by hitting the `Enter` key.
-    + The amount will be allocated and the `Balance` will show the unallocated portion.
-    + Continue these steps until the full amount has been allocated. In the event of a balance remaining which cannot be allocated, hitting the `Esc` key or clicking on the `Exit` button will exit the routine leaving the balance as unallocated.
-
-+ **History** - This is identical to `Normal` above but the available transactions will include previously fully allocated ones thus enabling you to reallocate transactions.
-+ **Oldest** - This will automatically allocate the amount against outstanding transactions, starting from the oldest transaction, until either the amount has been fully allocated or there are no more outstanding transactions in which case the balance will remain as unallocated.
-+ **Current** - This will leave the full transaction as unallocated.
-
-Printer Selection
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Whenever a report is being produced you will have the opportunity of deciding on the output method i.e. viewing, printing, exporting and, in some cases, whether or not to email it.  Please note that the option to email the report will only be available if there is a valid `SMTP Server` in the `System Record Maintenance`_ record.
-
-* **Output** - Select the required output option.
-* **Printer Name** - If you selected `Print`, enter the printer name.
-* **E-Mail Report** - If available, select whether or not to email the report.
-* **E-Mail Address** - If available, enter the email address, if more than one, comma separate them.
-
-Error Messages
---------------
-Should an error message occur and there is a file named *errors.txt* in the `Work Path` as created in `Preferences`_. Please email the file to errors@tartan.co.za after which you may delete it.
-
-Menus and Sub Menus
--------------------
-Please note that depending on the system modules selected when creating the company records, as detailed in `Company Records Maintenance`_, and the security level of the user, some of the menus detailed below might not appear.
-
