ver_5.0.7
=========
This version has been in production since April 2013 and is a Major Version
Change implementing, amongst many others, the following:

1)  Replaced Gtk widgets with Tkinter. The reason for this change is that
    Tkinter is the de facto standard for the python language and is packaged
    with it. In addition it is Python version 3 ready. This change required
    each and every module in the suite to be altered and tested resulting in
    numerous changes and hopefully many enhancements.
2)  Changed all modules to automatically alter the font size to fit the
    window geometry selected in the System --> Preferences --> Dialog routine.
3)  Modified the tooltip feature which can be turned on or off in the
    System --> Preferences --> General routine.
4)  Added colour schemes in the System --> Preferences --> Dialog routine.
5)  Added an additional option to set the label and button colours in the
    System --> Preferences --> Dialog routine.
6)  Allowed the facility to click on entry fields in some modules e.g. File
    Maintenance routines.
7)  Changed the VAT system to allow for VAT rate changes by date. This will
    facilitate any future VAT rate changes.
8)  Added a username to all transactions so that they can be interrogated to
    see which user generated them.
9)  Added the facility to report by department in the general ledger financial
    statements routine.
10) Added a 'Sale of Assets' control account to general ledger integration.
11) Changed some of the enquiry, F1, functions to support search filters.
12) Introduced bulk record inserts resulting in quicker restores and updates.
13) Added support for e-mail SMTP security and authentication in the
    Control --> System Records routine.
14) Improved the bulk mail utility to include additional systems and telephone
    directory contacts.
15) Implemented netbios file name resolution and access under linux.
16) Added a new system, Booking's Manager, which is a system for managing short
    term booking and letting of facilities like accomodation, functions and
    conferences.
